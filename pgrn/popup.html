  <h5>Project 1. Molecular determinants of statin efficacy and adverse effects in cellular models
Aim 1. Compare transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of in vitro simvastatin vs. sham exposed LCLs in samples derived from patients and controls with major adverse coronary events (MACE), and statin induced myopathy and type 2 diabetes.
Aim 2. Identify DNA variants associated with novel biomarkers identified in Aim 1, and with Project 3, test for their association with clinical phenotypes.
Aim 3. Perform in vitro hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies of candidate genes identified in all Projects.
